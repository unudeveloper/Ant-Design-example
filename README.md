# Styleguidist for Ant Design

Hello! This is an example intended to both supplement Ant Design's component documentation,
and to demonstrate the effects of using global `.less` overrides for customizing the look of
components within the framework (and see all of those effects on one page!)

### Get Started

```
yarn install
yarn run styleguide
```

TODO:
- [x] Configure webpack's `modifyVars`
- [x] Configure Styleguidist to load modified AntD components
- [ ] Add AntD's entire component library
- [ ] More documentation -- particularly any places where modifying globals causes weird behavior.

***This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).***
